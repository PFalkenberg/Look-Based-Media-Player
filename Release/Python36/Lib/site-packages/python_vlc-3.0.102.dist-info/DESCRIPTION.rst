This module provides ctypes-based bindings (see
http://wiki.videolan.org/PythonBinding) for the native libvlc
API (see http://wiki.videolan.org/LibVLC) of the VLC video
player. Note that it relies on an already present install of VLC.

It has been automatically generated from the include files of
vlc 3.0.0, using generator 1.2.
