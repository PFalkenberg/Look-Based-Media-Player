# Look-Based-Media-Player

This program is a media player that uses facial detection via webcam to automatically pause media playback when the user is not looking directly at the screen. When the user looks back at the screen, the media playback will automatically resume.

# My contribution

My contribution to this project is the Python code. I used OpenCV with Python to solve the issue of facial detection. The code will send out a flag to tell whether or not a face is detected, so that the media player code can decide when to play/pause.

#Disclaimer
This repo only contains source code and is not a deployable build of the program.
